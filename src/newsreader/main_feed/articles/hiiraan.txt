We will liberate the land in the coming years," Mr Jawar said at its launch.'}, {'p:As its then-chief executive officer, he turned the OMN into a powerful voice of the youth, whom he called "Qeerroo", which literally means "young unmarried man" - a term first popularised in the 1990s by the-then banned Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) rebel group in its bid to attract recruits.'}, {'p:Having grown up in the small town of Dhumuga where the OLF had a strong presence, Mr Jawar often said: "I was born in the Oromo struggle," as he recalled learning about the "oppression" of Oromos under the rule of emperors and autocrats alike.'}, {'p:Despite being the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, Mr Abiy was the first Oromo prime minister, while during the time of Emperor Haile Selassie, their language and traditional religion were banned.'}, {'p:A bright student, Mr Jawar left Ethiopia in his teens when he won a fellowship to study in Singapore in 2003. Two years later he moved to the US where he graduated with a political science degree from Stanford University and a masters degree in human rights at Colombia University in 2013.'}, {"p:'Strategic blunder over Abiy'"}, {'p:As a university student, Mr Jawar distanced himself from the OLF he had revered as a child, writing in a blog that it was "broken beyond repair" because of leadership disputes and factionalism.'}, {'p:But he continued to rally the large number of Oromos in the diaspora to support the "struggle" back home, which gained momentum after mass protests broke out in 2015, forcing the resignation of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn three years later.\n\n\nOromos have long felt politically and economically marginalised in Ethiopia.GETTY IMAGES'}, {'p:When Mr Abiy first emerged as Mr Hailemariam\'s potential successor, Mr Jawar warned that it would be a "strategic blunder" to give him the premiership, indicating a preference for current Defence Minister Lemma Megersa, whose political vision, Mr Jawar felt, was closer to his own.'}, {'p:But once Mr Abiy became the first Oromo to ever secure the premiership, the 34-year-old supported him, especially after he embarked on a series of reforms that saw the unbanning of opposition groups, the release of thousands of political prisoners, and the dropping of terrorism-related charges against exiles, including Mr Jawar, who then returned home to set up the OMN\'s headquarters in Addis Ababa as the voice of the "Qeerroo".'}, {"p:Mr Jawar's support for Mr Abiy, however, did not last long, as he maintained that self-rule was the key to stability and economic development for all ethnic groups, putting him on a collision course with the prime minister."}, {"p:For Mr Jawar's followers, his incarceration last week was further proof that Mr Abiy had betrayed their hopes - especially as his detention had come after much-awaited elections due next month had been indefinitely postponed. Election officials cited the coronavirus outbreak for the postponement."}, {'p:Jawar quit TV job'}, {'p:Mr Abiy had planned to contest the poll under the banner of his Prosperity Party, which he launched last year by getting eight ethnically-based parties to rally behind his "coming together" vision.'}, {"p:In contrast, Mr Jawar joined the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), and stepped down as the chief executive of the OMN's television station."}, {"p:The OFC had planned to form an alliance with the OLF and the Oromo National Party (ONP) to contest the election on what was expected to be a strong ethno-nationalist ticket, threatening Mr Abiy's support among Oromos in the ethnic group's heartland of Oromia."}, {'p:Following the postponement of the poll, Mr Jawar warned Mr Abiy that he would be an "illegitimate" prime minister once the term of the current parliament ended at the end of September.'}, {'p:Now, Mr Jawar finds himself incarcerated, with his party saying that both his lawyer and family had been denied access to him, and that he had embarked on a hunger strike.'}, {"p:Abiy's book burnt"}, {"p:For their part, police say they are pressing ahead with investigations to put Mr Jawar on trial for the murder of an officer allegedly shot by one of his bodyguards during protests which broke out last week in Addis Ababa following the killing of Hachalu - a musician who often sang about the Oromo's struggle for freedom."}, {"p:Mr Jawar's supporters said the policeman was killed by another officer, following a disagreement within their ranks over whether the opposition politician should be arrested."}, {'div:Police said Mr Jawar would also be prosecuted over protests that led to the deaths of 97 people last October after the politician released a video, alleging that the government was endangering his life by ordering the removal of his security detail.\nThe allegation - which police denied at the time - triggered a wave of protests that saw some of Mr Jawar\'s supporters burn copies of a book that Mr Abiy had published, outlining his "coming together" vision.\nWhile Mr Jawar denied inciting violence, the incident was seen as an attempt to embarrass the prime minister soon after he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for ending a border war with Ethiopia and for his efforts to democratise Ethiopia.\nPolice also raided the offices of the OMN in Addis Ababa last week, forcing its television station to once again start broadcasting from the US.\nWhether Mr Abiy can now regain the political initiative - or whether Mr Mohammed\'s detention galvanises the "Qeerroo" to step up their opposition to him - will become clear in the months ahead, leaving many Ethiopians anxious about the future.'}]
